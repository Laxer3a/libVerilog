# Verilog Useful Functions Library.

This is a list of various functions that can be useful and still because :
- They are OPTIMIZED.
- They are TESTED and PROVED to work.

All this library will be about combinatorial logic for mathematic or related operations :
- Signed and Unsigned saturated arithmetic.
- Signed division by a power of 2.
- Various rounding strategies.

# Documentation
- Each function is in a separate .v file because of ease of use with Verilator.
- Each function is documented inside the .v file.
- Test code is provided as a reference, but you can trust me for having RUN IT.
